 * Log out the current user and navigate to home page.

 * NOTE: `logoutUser` may be called multiple times concurrently (e.g., when
 * multiple concurrent requests return 403). To avoid performing the logout
 * actions multiple times, ensure the function is only called once. This is
 * safe because:
 *
 * 1. `logoutUser` triggers a browser navigation, which unloads the window (and
 *    resets this global variable).
 *
 * 2. `logoutUser` will never be called multiple times in one window with
 *    different `nextUrls`, making it okay to disregard `nextUrl`.
 *
 * @param {String} nextUrl - The URL to navigate to. In case the user's current
 *   domain does not match the domain of the current organization, this URL can
 *   be used to correct the URL.
